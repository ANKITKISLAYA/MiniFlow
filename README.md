# MINIFLOW - Mini Neural Network Library

This repository contains the MINIFLOW library, which is an implementation of a feedforward neural network along with backpropagation. The library is inspired by Udacity's MiniFlow and aims to provide a simplified version of TensorFlow for educational purposes.

## Table of Contents

- [MINIFLOW Library](./MiniFlow_Steps/miniflow.py): This Python module contains the MINIFLOW library, which provides the necessary classes and functions for building and training feedforward neural networks. The library includes components such as nodes, forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. It serves as a simplified version of TensorFlow and can be used to understand the inner workings of neural networks. 

- [MiniFlow.ipynb](./MiniFlow_Steps/MiniFlow.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook walks through the step-by-step implementation of the MINIFLOW library. It covers the construction of nodes, forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. The notebook provides detailed explanations and code snippets for each step. The PDF version of the notebook is also available for reference.

- [MiniFlow_Implementation_BostonHousing_Price.ipynb](./MiniFlow_Steps/MiniFlow_Implementation_BostonHousing_Price.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of the MINIFLOW library for predicting housing prices in Boston. The notebook covers data preprocessing, network architecture design using MINIFLOW, model training, and evaluation. The PDF version of the notebook is also available for reference.

## Usage

To use the MINIFLOW library, simply import the `miniflow.py` module from the `MiniFlow_Steps` folder into your Python project. The module provides classes and functions for building and training feedforward neural networks using MINIFLOW's simplified version of TensorFlow.

To run the `MiniFlow_Implementation_BostonHousing_Price.ipynb` notebook, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including MINIFLOW, numpy, and other required libraries. Clone this repository and open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results and observe the housing price predictions.

The PDF versions of the notebooks can be accessed for a quick overview of the code and concepts covered.

## Credits

I would like to give credit to Udacity for providing the guidance and resources that inspired the development of the MINIFLOW library and the Boston Housing Price Prediction project.
